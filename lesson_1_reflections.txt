Tool to compare files and easily find put the additions, changes and deletions on a file.

Helps to understand if something is wrong between versions of files / programs.

I did not know it existed in Windows.

By having easy access to the entire history of a file, I can see:

1) Progress
2) Changes done in each file
3) Find mistakes, improvements, new requirements.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro's - You decide when to commit and thus you are in control of the changes you want to keep track off.
Con's - If you abuse on the commit you will end with huge versions of the code and will have a hard time to find something.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they were designed to ease a documentation, programming, writing process. Tools like Google Docs are more
a Repository type of application.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- Git Log is a useful command to review which changes, additions or modifications were done in each commit done with GitHub.

- Git Diff will help to review / assess the changes done between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- Using Git and version control I can easily fidn changes in the files and code I do, so if by mistake I introduce a
code that is wrong in a version, finding the problem is easy.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- To keep track of changes on my developments mainly.
