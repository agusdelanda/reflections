When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to create a remote repository when:
A) I develop a project and I want people to contribute to it 
B) I form part of a project that requires development of different designers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is better to wait until you finish a round of improvements or changes so that you do not waste time pushing / pulling, 
improve your time spent on development and if you are colaborating you can share all your changes.
