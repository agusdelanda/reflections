When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to create a remote repository when:
A) I develop a project and I want people to contribute to it 
B) I form part of a project that requires development of different designers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is better to wait until you finish a round of improvements or changes so that you do not waste time pushing / pulling, 
improve your time spent on development and if you are colaborating you can share all your changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are operations in Git to have your repositories synchronized (Internet and Personal Computer).

Clones are copies of repositories that exist in GitHub (Internet)

Branches are to distinguish changes in repositories, they apply to GitHUB and Git.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

While working on a real world and with collaboration conflicts or changes to files will ocurr, so having a copy of the last known state will save a lot of work and also avoid problems.
